Finding a group of words (or themes) from a collection of documents that best captures the information in the collection of text documents is a process known as topic modelling. It can also be viewed as a type of text mining, which is a technique for identifying word patterns in textual data. The highlighted subjects are essential data points for assisting the business in determining where to focus its efforts on enhancing its goods or services.

In this project, we'll use Kmeans, an unsupervised technique, to cluster and group reviews in order to find the key concepts and ideas among the sea of text.
